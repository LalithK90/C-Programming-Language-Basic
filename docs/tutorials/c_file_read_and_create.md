# C File Read and Create Example

## Description
This C program demonstrates how to read content from an existing Markdown file (`.md`) and write that content into a new text file (`.txt`). It dynamically creates the output filename by changing the extension of the input filename.

## Code Explanation

**1. Header Inclusions:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
```
*   `stdio.h`: Standard Input/Output library, necessary for file operations (`FILE`, `fopen`, `fclose`, `fgets`, `fputs`, `printf`) and error reporting.
*   `string.h`: String manipulation library, used here for `strcpy`, `strrchr`, and `strcat` to handle filenames.

**2. `main` Function:**
```c
int main() {
    FILE *md_file, *txt_file; // File pointers
    char md_filename[] = "c_stdio_h_note.md"; // Input Markdown filename
    char txt_filename[256]; // Buffer for the output .txt filename
    char line[512]; // Buffer to store each line read from the file
```
*   `FILE *md_file, *txt_file;`: Declares two file pointers. `FILE` is a structure that holds information about a file stream.
*   `char md_filename[] = "c_stdio_h_note.md";`: Defines the name of the input Markdown file.
*   `char txt_filename[256];`: Declares a character array to store the generated output filename. 256 characters should be sufficient for most filenames.
*   `char line[512];`: Declares a character array (buffer) to hold each line read from the input file.

**3. Creating the Output Filename:**
```c
    // Create .txt filename based on .md filename
    strcpy(txt_filename, md_filename);
    char *dot = strrchr(txt_filename, '.');
    if (dot != NULL) {
        strcpy(dot, ".txt");
    } else {
        strcat(txt_filename, ".txt");
    }
```
*   `strcpy(txt_filename, md_filename);`: Copies the input filename (`c_stdio_h_note.md`) into `txt_filename`.
*   `char *dot = strrchr(txt_filename, '.');`: `strrchr` searches for the last occurrence of the character `.` (dot) in `txt_filename`. If found, `dot` will point to it; otherwise, `dot` will be `NULL`.
*   `if (dot != NULL)`: Checks if a dot was found (meaning there's likely an extension).
    *   `strcpy(dot, ".txt");`: If a dot is found, this overwrites the part of the string from the dot onwards with ".txt". For example, if `txt_filename` was "c_stdio_h_note.md", `dot` points to the `.` before `md`. `strcpy(dot, ".txt")` changes it to "c_stdio_h_note.txt".
*   `else`: If no dot was found (e.g., the filename had no extension).
    *   `strcat(txt_filename, ".txt");`: Appends ".txt" to the end of `txt_filename`.

**4. Opening the Markdown File for Reading:**
```c
    // Open the Markdown file for reading
    md_file = fopen(md_filename, "r");
    if (md_file == NULL) {
        printf("Could not open file %s\n", md_filename);
        return 1; // Indicate an error
    }
```
*   `md_file = fopen(md_filename, "r");`: Attempts to open the file specified by `md_filename` in read mode (`"r"`).
*   `if (md_file == NULL)`: Checks if `fopen` failed (e.g., file doesn't exist, no read permission). If it fails, `fopen` returns `NULL`.
    *   `printf(...)`: Prints an error message.
    *   `return 1;`: Exits the `main` function, returning 1 to the operating system, conventionally indicating an error.

**5. Opening the New Text File for Writing:**
```c
    // Open the new text file for writing
    txt_file = fopen(txt_filename, "w");
    if (txt_file == NULL) {
        printf("Could not create file %s\n", txt_filename);
        fclose(md_file); // Close the already opened md_file before exiting
        return 1; // Indicate an error
    }
```
*   `txt_file = fopen(txt_filename, "w");`: Attempts to open/create the file specified by `txt_filename` in write mode (`"w"`). If the file exists, its content will be overwritten. If it doesn't exist, it will be created.
*   `if (txt_file == NULL)`: Checks if `fopen` failed (e.g., no write permission, disk full).
    *   `printf(...)`: Prints an error message.
    *   `fclose(md_file);`: It's important to close any files that were successfully opened before exiting due to a subsequent error.
    *   `return 1;`: Exits with an error code.

**6. Reading from `.md` and Writing to `.txt`:**
```c
    // Read from .md and write to .txt
    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), md_file)) {
        fputs(line, txt_file);
    }
```
*   `while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), md_file))`: This is the core loop for copying content.
    *   `fgets(line, sizeof(line), md_file)`: Reads a line from `md_file`.
        *   `line`: The buffer to store the read line.
        *   `sizeof(line)`: The maximum number of characters to read (including the null terminator). This prevents buffer overflows.
        *   `md_file`: The file stream to read from.
        *   `fgets` reads up to `sizeof(line) - 1` characters, or until a newline `\n` is encountered, or until EOF (End Of File) is reached. It includes the newline character in the buffer if read, and null-terminates the string.
        *   `fgets` returns `line` (a pointer to the buffer) on success, and `NULL` on error or when EOF is reached and no characters were read. The `while` loop continues as long as `fgets` successfully reads a line.
    *   `fputs(line, txt_file);`: Writes the string `line` (which was read from `md_file`) to `txt_file`. `fputs` does not add a newline character; it writes the string as is.

**7. Closing Files and Success Message:**
```c
    fclose(md_file);
    fclose(txt_file);

    printf("Content copied from %s to %s\n", md_filename, txt_filename);
    return 0; // Indicate successful execution
}
```
*   `fclose(md_file);`: Closes the input Markdown file, releasing system resources associated with it.
*   `fclose(txt_file);`: Closes the output text file, ensuring all buffered data is written to disk and releasing resources.
*   `printf(...)`: Prints a success message indicating the source and destination filenames.
*   `return 0;`: Exits the `main` function, returning 0 to the operating system, conventionally indicating successful execution.

## Prerequisites for Running

For this program to run as intended, you need a file named `c_stdio_h_note.md` in the same directory where you compile and run the executable. The content of this file will be copied.

**Example `c_stdio_h_note.md`:**
```markdown
This is a sample Markdown file.
It has multiple lines.
This content will be copied to a .txt file.
```

## Example Usage

1.  **Save the code:** Save the C code above as `file_copy.c` (or any other `.c` name).
2.  **Create `c_stdio_h_note.md`:** Create this file in the same directory with some content.
3.  **Compile the code:**
    ```bash
    gcc file_copy.c -o file_copy
    ```
4.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./file_copy
    ```

**Expected Output (on the console):**
```
Content copied from c_stdio_h_note.md to c_stdio_h_note.txt
```

**Result:**
A new file named `c_stdio_h_note.txt` will be created in the same directory. Its content will be identical to the content of `c_stdio_h_note.md`.

## Key Concepts

*   **File I/O:** The process of reading from and writing to files.
*   **File Pointers (`FILE*`):** Variables that store information about an open file stream.
*   **`fopen()`:** Standard library function to open a file. Takes filename and mode (e.g., `"r"` for read, `"w"` for write, `"a"` for append) as arguments.
*   **`fclose()`:** Standard library function to close an open file, flushing buffers and releasing resources.
*   **`fgets()`:** Reads a line of text from a file stream into a buffer. Good for preventing buffer overflows because it takes the buffer size as an argument.
*   **`fputs()`:** Writes a string to a file stream.
*   **Error Handling:** Checking the return values of file operations (like `fopen`) for `NULL` to detect and handle errors.
*   **String Manipulation (`string.h`):**
    *   `strcpy()`: Copies a string.
    *   `strrchr()`: Finds the last occurrence of a character in a string.
    *   `strcat()`: Concatenates (appends) one string to another.
*   **Return Codes:** The `main` function returns an integer to the operating system (0 for success, non-zero for errors).
